# Mountain Of Anzu
Action RPG to teach myself rust/wasm/webgl. There's not much going on here yet, a bunch of squares and recangles bounce around a colorful background.

## Getting Started

There's two ways to get started. The easy way and the other easy way.

The easy way.

1. Clone the development branch
1. [Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
1. [Install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [Install wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
1. npm install
1. wasm-pack build
1. npm run dev
1. Behold the squares

The other easy way, with containerized development environment. 

1. Clone the development branch
1. Open VS Code
1. Install the remote development extension
1. Connect to the Alpine-Dev-Env.Dockerfile defined container
1. npm install
1. wasm-pack build
1. npm run dev
1. Behold the squares

### Prerequisites

The Mountain of Anzu requres npm, rust, and wasm-pack for rust.

```
npm -v
6.14.5
```

```
cargo -V
cargo 1.42.0
```

```
wasm-pack -V
wasm-pack 0.81
```

### Installing

There's always more than one way to get your environment set up.
The two methods that I use are described below, your milage may vary.

## Method one: local installation

Follow the instructions for your operating system and install these following packages:

[Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

[Install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

[Install wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)

You will also need git to clone the repo.

Once you have the required packages installed and the development branch cloned, you should be able to build the source and run a local node server to host the content.

## Method two: developing in a container
The Alpine-Dev-Env.Dockerfile contains everything you will need to begin developing this project. 

Refer to your operating system's instructions to install docker and confiugre it to run Linux containers.

<!--Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
